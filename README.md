Build log of a basic EEG signal acquisition prototype. Raw signals first, refinement later.I’m building a basic EEG signal acquisition setup. I’ve reached the stage where I’m getting raw/noisy signals and plotting them.  Repo + images here: [GitHub link]  Looking for feedback on signal quality / next steps.
